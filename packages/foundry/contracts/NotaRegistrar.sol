 * =======================
 * @title Denota Protocol
 * @author Almaraz.eth
 * @custom:description Denota Protocol (beta)- a token agreement protocol.
 * The core primitive is the Nota, an NFT that represents the ownership of underlying assets and issued by the NotaRegistrar.
 * Each Nota can escrow ERC20s and references a module which enforces the rules of both the Nota's ownership and it's escrowed funds.
 * 
 * HOW TO USE:
 * The main relevant functions for most Notas will be WTFCAT or Write (mint), Transfer, Fund, Cash, Approve, and TokenURI.
 * Writing a Nota requires approval of: your tokens so they can be escrowed, and both module and tokens you wish to use 
 * * NOTE The `moduleBytes` parameter are special arguments needed from the module being referenced. Please refer to the module for what (if any) bytes argument format it is expecting and use an abi.encode website to assist.
 * Whitelisting of modules and tokens is controlled by the deployer (me, for now) but only apply when creating new Notas. It's permissioned for safety purposes and is the only thing the NotaRegistrar's owner controls.
 * Notas are compatible with NFT marketplaces, and provide detailed and trustable metadata for display.
 * HOW TO PROFIT:
 * Each module can charge a fee every time a Nota that references it is used. Registering your account to a module allows you to collect the fees the module generates
