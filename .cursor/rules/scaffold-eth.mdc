This codebase contains Scaffold-ETH 2 (SE-2), everything you need to build dApps on Ethereum. Its tech stack is NextJS, RainbowKit, Wagmi and Typescript. Supports Hardhat and Foundry.

It's a yarn monorepo that contains two main packages:

- Hardhat (`packages/hardhat`): The solidity framework to write, test and deploy EVM Smart Contracts.
- NextJS (`packages/nextjs`): The UI framework extended with utilities to make interacting with Smart Contracts easy (using Next.js App Router, not Pages Router).

The usual dev flow is:

- Start SE-2 locally:
  - `yarn chain`: Starts a local blockchain network
  - `yarn deploy`: Deploys SE-2 default contract
  - `yarn start`: Starts the frontend
- Write a Smart Contract (modify the deployment script in `packages/hardhat/deploy` if needed)
- Deploy it locally (`yarn deploy`)
- Go to the `http://locahost:3000/debug` page to interact with your contract with a nice UI
- Iterate until you get the functionality you want in your contract
- Write tests for the contract in `packages/hardhat/test`
- Create your custom UI using all the SE-2 components, hooks, and utilities.
- Deploy your Smart Contrac to a live network
- Deploy your UI (`yarn vercel` or `yarn ipfs`)
  - You can tweak which network the frontend is poiting (and some other configurations) in `scaffold.config.ts`

## Smart Contract UI interactions guidelines

SE-2 provides a set of hooks that facilitates contract interactions from the UI. It reads the contract data from `deployedContracts.ts` and `externalContracts.ts`, located in `packages/nextjs/contracts`.

### Reading data from a contract

Use the `useScaffoldReadContract` (`packages/nextjs/hooks/scaffold-eth/useScaffoldReadContract.ts`) hook. Example:

```typescript
const { data: someData } = useScaffoldReadContract({
  contractName: "YourContract",
  functionName: "functionName",
  args: [arg1, arg2], // optional
});
```

### Writing data to a contract

Use the `useScaffoldWriteContract` (`packages/nextjs/hooks/scaffold-eth/useScaffoldWriteContract.ts`) hook.

1. Initilize the hook with just the contract name
2. Call the `writeContractAsync` function.

Example:

```typescript
const { writeContractAsync: writeYourContractAsync } = useScaffoldWriteContract(
  { contractName: "YourContract" }
);

// Usage (this will send a write transaction to the contract)
await writeContractAsync({
  functionName: "functionName",
  args: [arg1, arg2], // optional
  value: parseEther("0.1"), // optional, for payable functions
});
```

Never use any other patterns for contract interaction. The hooks are:

- useScaffoldReadContract (for reading)
- useScaffoldWriteContract (for writing)

### Reading events from a contract

Use the `useScaffoldEventHistory` (`packages/nextjs/hooks/scaffold-eth/useScaffoldEventHistory.ts`) hook.

Example:

```typescript
const {
  data: events,
  isLoading,
  error,
} = useScaffoldEventHistory({
  contractName: "YourContract",
  eventName: "GreetingChange",
  watch: true, // optional, if true, the hook will watch for new events
});
```

The `data` property consists of an array of events and can be displayed as:

```jsx
<div>
  {events?.map((event) => (
    <div key={event.logIndex}>
      <p>{event.args.greetingSetter}</p>
      <p>{event.args.newGreeting}</p>
      <p>{event.args.premium}</p>
      <p>{event.args.value}</p>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```

### Other Hooks

SE-2 also provides other hooks to interact with blockchain data: `useScaffoldWatchContractEvent`, `useScaffoldEventHistory`, `useDeployedContractInfo`, `useScaffoldContract`, `useTransactor`. They live under `packages/nextjs/hooks/scaffold-eth`.

## Display Components guidelines

With the `@scaffold-ui/components` library, SE-2 provides a set of pre-built React components for common Ethereum use cases:

- `Address`: Always use this when displaying an ETH address
- `AddressInput`: Always use this when users need to input an ETH address
- `Balance`: Display the ETH/USDC balance of a given address
- `EtherInput`: An extended number input with ETH/USD conversion.

For fully customizable components, you can use the hooks from the `@scaffold-ui/hooks` library to get the data you need.
