When the user asks how to interact with contracts, always prefer Scaffold-ETH hooks.

# Reading from contracts

- When reading data from contracts, use [useScaffoldReadContract.ts](mdc:packages/nextjs/hooks/scaffold-eth/useScaffoldReadContract.ts).


# Writing to contracts

- When writing to contracts, use [useScaffoldWriteContract.ts](mdc:packages/nextjs/hooks/scaffold-eth/useScaffoldWriteContract.ts).
